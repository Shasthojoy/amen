Title: Additive and Multiplicative Effects Models for Networks and Relational
    Data
Version: 1.3
Author: Peter Hoff, Bailey Fosdick, Alex Volfovsky, Yanjun He
Description: Analysis of dyadic network and relational data using additive and
    multiplicative effects (AME) models. The basic model includes
    regression terms, the covariance structure of the social relations model
    (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979), Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor
    models (Hoff(2009)). Four different link functions accommodate different
    relational data structures, including binary/network data (bin), normal
    relational data (nrm), ordinal relational data (ord) and data from
    fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).  Several of these link functions are
    discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013). Development of this
    software was supported in part by NIH grant R01HD067509.
